# Communitree:
This rails project was really good practice to put in test all the skills I have been learning so far. It was hard trying to remember all the stuff I have learned. But google helped a lot lol.

My wife had this amazing idea about trees how they help each other by sharing their resources. She wants human to have the same idology. So why not build an app where people within the same community can help each other.

The app basically requires you to have an account. You can register as a new user by providing your information or you can login via Facebook. After you login, you will be redirected to your home page where you can create a new service and help others with thier services. Services are categorized. You can look up services by category or search through the services by a word. The application is programmed to search through a service tile or its description to find services. A user can assign a service to them selvies if they feel they can provide that service. Only the user who created a service can take down that service.
