Hello, my name is Shaqqour. Just Shaqqour. One word, like Tupac or Beyonce. I recently graduated from the Flatiron School Full-Stack Software Engineering Course. I did the part-time course which took 10 months to complete. I had a great experience and I wanted to share with you some of the reasons why you should consider signing up.

### Work in a merged language enviroment.
In Flatiron you learn how to connect and work with different programming languages. While a university works in silos, they teach you Java, SQL, and Ruby separately but not how they work together. At Flatiron, they taught us how to connect all these different pieces to make a well functioned project.

### There are no tests/exams.
You graduate and learn by working through real projects, not taking exams. If you are a learn by doing person like myself, you will love it.

### You will have portfolio
This means you have a portfolio when you graduate, which is helpful to show prospective employers. You are required in Flatiron to build a project after each mode. By the end of the course you will have 5 projects you can add to your portfolio.

### One year access to a Wework
It is a nice coworking space. Where you can do all your bootcamp work and at the same time you get to meet people and make connections.

### You learn the latest technology
For example, React. It is a web development language that is in high demand these days because it is simple, efficient, organized, easy to learn and maintain, and the code can be reused. An application that is built with React will load and respond much faster, than another with plain JavaScript.

It has been a long and exciting journey, despite all the reading and exercises. At the end of the day, I would not have been able to learn a lot of this on my own. For that, I highly recommend Flatiron.
